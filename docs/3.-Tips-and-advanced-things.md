# 3. Tips and advanced things

Using the client is pretty simple to use once you understand how things work. Though there might be a few things that
need some clarification, this is what this section is for.

## Handling the errors

Regardless of whether you use blocking or non-blocking strategy to interact with the Geometry Dash API, handling errors
properly is something important. To help with that, each method of `AnonymousGDClient` and `AuthenticatedGDClient`
specifies all kinds of errors in their javadoc that may happen when calling them. In a general way, any call of any of
the methods of the clients may produce those 3 errors:

- `BadResponseException`: happens when the Geometry Dash server returns an HTTP error (like a `404 Not Found` or
  a `500 Internal Server Error` for instance)
- `MissingAccessException`: certainly the most common error. Happens when nothing is found (e.g a level search gave no
  results), or when access to the resource is denied (e.g trying to fetch a user profile with an authenticated client,
  and the user has blocked the account that the client is logged on). Unfortunately there is no way to distinguish those
  two situations due to how the Geometry Dash API is designed. For those who are familiar with the raw Geometry Dash
  API, this is when the server returns `-1`.
- `CorruptedResponseContentException`: happens when the Geometry Dash server returns a response that cannot be parsed to
  the desired object. This should rarely happen in normal conditions, but it may be more frequent when you use JDash on
  a Geometry Dash private server.

Besides those, additional errors may be listed for specific methods. For example, if you look at the
method `getDailyLevel()`, you can see that it may also emit a `NoTimelyAvailableException`, which happens when no Daily
level or Weekly demon is available. Additionally, if you have configured a request timeout when building the client, it
can be handled by intercepting a `TimeoutException`.

## The `GDPaginator` class

When a request may return several results, the method corresponding to the request will return a `GDPaginator`.
A `GDPaginator` contains info on how many elements were found, how many pages there are, how many elements there are per
page, and a `List` containing the actual elements for the current page. If you try to print a `GDPaginator` instance,
the `toString()` method will give an output similar to this:

```

You can see all information that a `GDPaginator` can hold. In the code, you have access to this information. In this
example, let's say you are browsing levels on GD:

```Java
int pageNumber = paginator.getPageNumber(); // The current page number
int maxSizePerPage = paginator.getMaxSizePerPage(); // Max number of elements per page
int totalSize = paginator.getTotalSize(); // Total number of elements found
boolean hasNextPage = paginator.hasNextPage(); // Whether you can go to next page
boolean hasPreviousPage = paginator.hasPreviousPage(); // Whether you can go to previous page
int totalNumberOfPages = paginator.getTotalNumberOfPages(); // The total number of pages
List<GDLevel> elements = paginator.asList(); // Get the list of elements on the current page
Mono<GDPaginator<GDLevel>> nextPage = paginator.goToNextPage(); // Returns a new GDPaginator containing elements on the next page
Mono<GDPaginator<GDLevel>> previousPage = paginator.goToPreviousPage(); // Returns a new GDPaginator containing elements on the next page
Mono<GDPaginator<GDLevel>> page6 = paginator.goTo(6); // Returns a new GDPaginator containing elements on the 6th page
```

Since `GDPaginator` implements `Iterable`, you can loop through all elements easily using the syntax:

```Java
for (GDLevel element : paginator) {
	// code
}
```

which is strictly equivalent to:

```Java
List<GDLevel> elements = paginator.asList();
for (GDLevel element : elements) {
	// code
}
```

One important thing to know is that in the code, **all page numbers are zero-indexed**. First page is page 0, second
page is page 1, and so on. The `toString()` method aim to provide a more user-friendly way to display things, that's why
page numbers start at 1 there.

## Lazy properties

When you request some things using the client, sometimes the client won't give you everything at once. This is the case
when getting a specific information on an entity requires an extra request to the GD servers. For instance, for
a `GDLevel`, you won't have any issues getting the level ID, the level name, or the description.

```Java
long id = level.getId();
String name = level.getName();
String description = level.getDescription();
```

But what if you want to get information on the song that the level uses?

```Java
Mono<GDSong> = level.getSong();
```

Yup, it doesn't return the `GDSong` directly, but a `Mono` of it. This is because there are some cases where song info
is not given along with the level data. That's why it would need to make another request to get song info. To get the
value of the song, it's done by the same way, either you `block()` it, or you define a callback then `subscribe()` it,
as you would do for a normal request.

Though, if you want nothing but the song, you can use `flatMap` to discard level info and only extract song info:

```Java
GDSong song = client.getLevelById(id)
		.flatMap(GDLevel::getSong)
		.block();
```

## Generating user icons

Since JDash v3.1.0, it is possible to generate user icons into an image format manipulable with Java Graphics APIs. In
this example, we are fetching RobTop's profile, generating his icons and saving then in a .png format in your system's
temporary directory:

```Java
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

import javax.imageio.ImageIO;

import jdash.jdash.client.AnonymousGDClient;
import jdash.jdash.client.GDClientBuilder;
import jdash.jdash.entity.GDUser;
import jdash.jdash.entity.IconType;
import jdash.jdash.exception.SpriteLoadException;
import jdash.graphics.SpriteFactory;
import jdash.jdash.util.GDUserIconSet;

public class GraphicsTestMain {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws SpriteLoadException {
        // Build the client
        AnonymousGDClient client = GDClientBuilder.create().buildAnonymous();
        // Fetch RobTop's profile
        GDUser user = client.searchUser("RobTop").block();
        // Instanciate the SpriteFactory
        SpriteFactory sf = SpriteFactory.create();
        // Read the user's icon set
        GDUserIconSet iconSet = new GDUserIconSet(user, sf);
        // For each existing icon type (cube, ship, UFO, etc), generate the image
        BufferedImage mainIcon = iconSet.generateIcon(user.getMainIconType());
        BufferedImage cube = iconSet.generateIcon(IconType.CUBE);
        BufferedImage ship = iconSet.generateIcon(IconType.SHIP);
        BufferedImage ball = iconSet.generateIcon(IconType.BALL);
        BufferedImage ufo = iconSet.generateIcon(IconType.UFO);
        BufferedImage wave = iconSet.generateIcon(IconType.WAVE);
        BufferedImage robot = iconSet.generateIcon(IconType.ROBOT);
        BufferedImage spider = iconSet.generateIcon(IconType.SPIDER);
        // Save the images
        savePNG(mainIcon, "RobTop-Main");
        savePNG(cube, "RobTop-Cube");
        savePNG(ship, "RobTop-Ship");
        savePNG(ball, "RobTop-Ball");
        savePNG(ufo, "RobTop-Ufo");
        savePNG(wave, "RobTop-Wave");
        savePNG(robot, "RobTop-Robot");
        savePNG(spider, "RobTop-Spider");
    }

    /**
     * Utility method to save an image into a PNG format in the system's temporary directory.
     */
    private static void savePNG(BufferedImage img, String name) {
        try {
            String path = System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir") + File.separator + name + ".png";
            ImageIO.write(img, "png", new File(path));
            System.out.println("Saved " + path);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
