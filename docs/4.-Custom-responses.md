# 4. Custom responses

To build the response of a HTTP request, JDash already provides a set of objects such as `GDLevel`, `GDUser`, `GDComponentList`, etc.

But it is possible to build the response with your own objects. This is what this section will show you.

## The `GDComponent` interface

All of the objects mentionned above (`GDLevel`, `GDUser`, etc) actually implement an interface called `GDComponent`. Indeed, you can see that the declaration of the `GDHttpRequest` superclass looks like:

```Java
public abstract class GDHttpRequest<T extends GDComponent> {
	// ...
}
```

The `GDComponent` interface has no method to be implemented. But it is necessary to make your own object implement it so it can be instanciated by the client upon receiving the response.

## Example

Let's say you want to get the raw data of a level returned by the server, and store it as a `String`.
The `String` object does not implement `GDComponent`, so you need to make a class that encapsulates a `String` and that implements the interface.

```Java
public class CustomString implements GDComponent {
	private String data;
	
	public CustomString(String data) {
		this.data = data;
	}
	
	public String getData() {
		return this.data;
	}
}
```

Now you need to make your own `GDHttpResponseBuilder<T>`. This is a functional interface, which means you can implement it using a lambda expression. Its method takes in parameter the raw data returned by the server, and parses it in order to build the response object. Each `GDHttpRequest<T>` implement their own `GDHttpResponseBuilder<T>` that build an object of type `T`. So all you need to do is to make a class that will extend `GDHttpRequest<CustomString>` and override its method `responseBuilderInstance()`. It may not be clear, so here's the code for it:

```Java
public class CustomStringLevelHttpRequest extends GDHttpRequest<CustomString> {
	// This constructor must define the URL to request and the POST parameters.
	// Just copy them from GDLevelHttpRequest's constructor
	public CustomStringLevelHttpRequest(long levelID) {
		super("/downloadGJLevel22.php", false);
		this.getParams().put("levelID", "" + levelID);
	}

	@Override
	public GDHttpResponseBuilder<CustomString> responseBuilderInstance() {
		return response -> new CustomString(response);
	}
}
```

You can now build `CustomString` instances by requesting the Geometry Dash servers!

```Java
GDHttpClient client = new GDHttpClient();
CustomStringHttpRequest request = new CustomStringHttpRequest(10565740);
CustomString response = null;
try {
	response = client.fetch(request);
} catch (GDAPIException e) {
	e.printStackTrace()
	return;
}

if (response != null) {
	System.out.println(response.getData());
}
```
