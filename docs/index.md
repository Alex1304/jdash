# JDash Documentation

## Presentation

JDash is a public Java library for the Geometry Dash API. 
Geometry Dash is a platform game for PC and mobile made by RobTopGames.
This game has online features such as levels, player stats, friends and private messaging system, etc.
The point of this library is to access online data from the game and process them in your own Java program.
This library hasn't been made in any form of partnership with RobTopGames. This means that we have absolutely
no control over the Geometry Dash API itself. This library shall be actively updated to prevent any incompatibility
or dysfunction due to a major change of the API in the game's side.
